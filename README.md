1. Overview of the Project
   The application consists of two main components:

Chat Module: Handles single and multi-prompt text conversations with OpenAI.
Image Generation Module: Facilitates the generation of single or multiple AI-generated images based on prompts.
Both modules are exposed via REST APIs, making them easy to use for front-end integration or external services.

2. Key Features
   Single Chat API: Sends a user prompt to OpenAI and returns a response.
   Multi-Chat API: Handles multiple chat messages in a single request, ideal for structured conversations.
   Single Image Generation API: Generates an image based on a descriptive prompt.
   Multi-Image Generation API: Produces multiple images in response to a single request.
   Each API endpoint is validated using jakarta.validation to ensure data integrity and robustness.

3. Technical Implementation
   The project is implemented in Java 17 using the Spring Boot framework. Below are the details of the two primary components:

ChatController
This class provides REST endpoints for handling text-based chat prompts.
The chat method processes a single message request, while the multiChat method handles multiple prompts in one go.
Key Dependencies:
ChatGPTMessageService to interact with the OpenAI API for text generation.
@Valid and @NotNull annotations ensure input validation.
ImageController
This class provides REST endpoints for generating AI-based images.
The chat method generates a single image, while the multiChat method creates multiple images.
Key Dependencies:
ChatGPTImageService handles communication with OpenAI for image generation.
List handling for multiple image responses.
Both controllers are designed with separation of concerns in mind, ensuring that business logic resides in the respective service classes.

4. Project Workflow
   Step 1: Request Handling
   The application accepts requests through JSON payloads containing prompts or messages. These requests are processed by their respective endpoints.

Step 2: Service Interaction
The controllers delegate the business logic to the service layer (ChatGPTMessageService and ChatGPTImageService). These services manage the actual communication with OpenAI APIs.

Step 3: API Response
The OpenAI responses (text or images) are formatted and returned to the client through ResponseEntity. Appropriate HTTP status codes ensure clear communication of success or failure.

5. API Endpoints
   Here are the endpoints I’ve implemented:

Endpoint	Method	Description
/chat	POST	Handles single text prompts for chat responses.
/chat/multi	POST	Processes multiple prompts in a single request.
/generate/image	POST	Generates a single image based on a user prompt.
/generate/images	POST	Generates multiple images from a single descriptive prompt.
6. OpenAI API Key Setup
   To use OpenAI’s API, you’ll need an API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

Visit OpenAI’s Platform
Go to the OpenAI API page: https://platform.openai.com/signup/
Sign up or log in with your account.

Generate Your API Key

Navigate to Personal > API Keys in the platform.
Click Create new secret key to generate a key.
Save Your Key Securely

Once generated, copy and securely save the key. You won’t be able to view it again.
Use this key in your project to authenticate API requests.
Environment Variable Setup
For better security, add the API key to an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
Then retrieve it in your Java code using:

java
Copy code
System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY");
7. Why This Project Matters
   This project demonstrates how backend developers can leverage state-of-the-art AI models to build intelligent applications. It’s a step towards making AI accessible to businesses and end-users for tasks like automation, creative content generation, and more.

8. What’s Next?
   Frontend Integration: I plan to build a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with these APIs.
   Enhancements: Add caching for frequent responses and integrate virtual threads (from Java 21) for optimized performance in high-load scenarios.
